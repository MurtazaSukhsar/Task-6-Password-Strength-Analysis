# Task 6 â€“ Password Strength Analysis

## Objective
To evaluate the strength of different passwords using the online tool [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com/) and understand how different character combinations affect security.

## Methodology
1. Accessed [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com/).
2. Tested multiple passwords with variations in:
   - Length
   - Uppercase letters
   - Lowercase letters
   - Numbers
   - Symbols
3. Recorded scores, complexity levels, and deductions.

## Test Results

| Password              | Score  | Complexity     | Key Strengths                                     | Weaknesses/Deductions                            |
|-----------------------|--------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Abcd1234!**         | 82%    | Very Strong   | Good mix of cases, numbers, symbols               | Minor deductions for consecutive lowercase/numbers |
| **Abcd1234**          | 64%    | Strong        | Meets length & character variety                  | No symbols, minor consecutive character deductions |
| **abcd1234**          | 38%    | Weak          | Numbers included                                  | No uppercase, no symbols, low variety            |
| **Str0ng!Pass2025**   | 100%   | Very Strong   | Excellent variety & length, multiple types of chars| Minor deduction for consecutive lowercase        |
| **M#rt@zAl_2025_R0cks** | 100% | Very Strong   | Long, highly complex, excellent mix               | Minor deduction for consecutive characters       |

## Observations
- Adding **symbols** and increasing **length** significantly improves password strength.
- Using **uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols** meets maximum security recommendations.
- Avoid **consecutive letters or numbers** to reduce deductions.
- **Complexity** improves drastically when passwords are 12+ characters long.

## Conclusion
Strong passwords require:
- At least **12 characters**
- A mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- Avoiding predictable sequences and repeated patterns

Based on the results, **M#rt@zAl_2025_R0cks** and **Str0ng!Pass2025** are the most secure among the tested passwords.
